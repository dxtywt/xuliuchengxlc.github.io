Whenever I think of you, I would write something here. You would never know those words, I guess, even the essay comes to your face, for it is hardly for you to spend time reading papers like those. I just want to know when is the end for the memory of you. This post may also indicates my poor english at the same time. However, if the process will exist for a long time, ..... then leave it alone. 

Nothing improves the memory more than you try to forget, which is absolutely right. Another words just comes to me -- I like you, but just like you. Chinese is indeed great lanuage as well as definitely gorgeous. When the previous sentense translated into Chinese, it is really beautiful, although someone think the kind of translation is obviously excessive.But who cares? I do not even give a shit about this.

Sometimes ever, sometimes never.
